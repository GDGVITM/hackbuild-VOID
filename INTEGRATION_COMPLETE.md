# 🎯 DATABASE-FRONTEND INTEGRATION - FIXED!

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Mock Data Contamination** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Frontend was mixing demo/mock data with real database data
**Solution**: 
- Removed all mock data imports and dependencies
- Updated App.tsx to use only real database data
- Set empty arrays as fallbacks instead of mock data

### 2. **Map Points Not Showing** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Map wasn't displaying interactive disaster points from database
**Solution**:
- Updated InteractiveMap component to render database disaster posts
- Added disaster-specific icons with urgency-based sizing
- Created proper popup components for disaster alerts
- Added disaster type color coding (earthquake=purple, flood=blue, fire=red, etc.)

### 3. **Feed Not Showing Database Data** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: NewsFeed was displaying demo data instead of real disasters
**Solution**:
- Updated Post type interface to include disaster_info
- Fixed data conversion in disasterApi service
- Ensured disaster metadata flows through to frontend

## 🗃️ Database Schema Integration

**Database Fields Mapped to Frontend**:
```
Database → Frontend
├── post_id → id
├── title + content → content  
├── author → userHandle
├── place → location.name
├── disaster_type → disaster_info.type
├── urgency_level → disaster_info.urgency_level  
├── confidence_level → disaster_info.confidence_level
├── post_time → timestamp
└── sources → disaster_info.sources
```

**Live Data Flow**:
```
SQLite Database → Flask API → React Frontend
        ↓              ↓            ↓
   6 disasters    6 endpoints   Live updates
```
